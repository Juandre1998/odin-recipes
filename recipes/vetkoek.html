            <h2>A traditional South African vetkoek</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 	kg 	Cake or Bread flour</li>
                <li>15 	ml 	Salt</li>
                <li>60 	ml 	Sugar</li>
                <li>60 	g 	Margarine</li>
                <li>10 	g 	Anchor Instant Yeast</li>
                <li>625 ml 	Lukewarm water</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the cake or bread flour, salt and sugar together and rub the margarine into the flour, with the fingertips. Add the Anchor Instant Yeast and mix.</li>
                <li>Add the lukewarm water to the flour mixture to form a soft dough. Add a little more water, if necessary. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Cover with greased plastic and rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Knock the dough down and roll into a roll. Cut into 24 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place them onto a well, greased tray - in order to be able to lift the risen balls.</li>
                <li>Cover with greased plastic and allow to rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, pour oil into a large saucepan, about â…“ filled. Heat the oil for about 5 minutes before the frying time. Place a piece of dough into the oil to test the heat. (Slight bubbles around the dough, is an indication that the oil has warmed enough to be used).</li>
                <li>When the oil is ready, lift a risen ball carefully and place it into the warm oil - with the risen side (top) going in first, which will cause the flat side (bottom) to rise and puff out to make a round Vetkoek. Allow to colour on the one side for about 5 minutes and turn. Fry for a further 5 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oil with a draining spoon and drain on paper towel or brown paper.</li>
            </ol>
